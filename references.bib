		A growing social science literature has used Twitter and Facebook to study
		political and social phenomena including for election forecasting and
		tracking political conversations. This research note uses a nationally
		representative probability sample of the British population to examine how
		Twitter and Facebook users differ from the general population in terms of
		demographics, political attitudes and political behaviour. We find that
		Twitter and Facebook users differ substantially from the general population
		on many politically relevant dimensions including vote choice, turnout, age,
		gender, and education. On average social media users are younger and better
		educated than non-users, and they are more liberal and pay more attention to
		politics. Despite paying more attention to politics, social media users are
		less likely to vote than non-users, but they are more likely to support the
		left leaning Labour Party when they do vote. However, we show that these
		apparent differences mostly arise due to the demographic composition of
		social media users. After controlling for age, gender, and education, no
		statistically significant differences arise between social media users and
		non-users on political attention, values or political behaviour.

		-Approaches to advertising have changed dramatically over the past 50 years,

		advances in technology consumers are now in control of the media message they
		want to become exposed to. They have the option of watching TV programmes
		without having to view advertisements, they can listen to radio without
		having to hear the advertisements, they can alter their mail boxes so that
		SPAM mail goes directly to their junk folder and they can minimise advert pop
		ups when surfing online. Marketers are being forced to consider another form
		of marketing that would reach target customers in a new way. This paper
		examines how Facebook, has incorporated advertising into its site and

		Several recent studies have explored the virtues of behavio ral targeting and
		personaliza- tion for online advertising. In this paper, we add to this lit
		erature by proposing a cost-effective methodology for the prediction of
		demographic website visi tor profiles that can be used for web advertising
		targeting purposes. The methodology involves the transformation of website
		visitors' clickstream patterns to a set of features and the training of
		Random Forest classifiers that generate predictions for gender, age, level of
		education and occupat ion category. These demographic predic- tions can
		support online advertisement targeting (i) as an a dditional input in
		personalized advertising or behavioral targeting, or (ii) as an input for
		aggregated d emographic website visitor profiles that support marketing
		managers in selecting websites and achie ving an optimal correspondence
		between target groups and website audience composition. The propos ed
		methodology is validated using data from a Belgian web metrics company. The
		results reveal that R andom Forests demonstrate superior classification
		performance over a set of benchmark algorith ms. Further, the ability of the
		model set to generate representative demographic website audience p rofiles
		is assessed. The stability of the models over time is demonstrated using
		out-of-period data.

		As social media provide athletic departments and their constituents with an
		additional point of engagement with their fans, it is important to understand
		the social media audience. However, despite the growth of social media use
		among collegiate athletic departments, coaches, and teams, relatively little
		is known about the individuals who are utilizing various social media forums.
		This study was the first to attempt to understand why college sport fans
		engage in sport-focused social media use, with a theoretical grounding in
		uses and gratifications. Utilizing a survey of student fans from a large
		Division 1 institution, the results suggest that there is a relatively low
		level of social media participation among college sport fans in relation to
		official Twitter and Facebook feeds of the team, and a surprising prevalence
		of traditional media usage for informational purposes. Factor analysis
		reveals dimen-sions of gratification for social media use include content
		creation as an identifiable factor. These and other findings are discussed.

		We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2

		1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error
		rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0{\%} which is considerably better than the previous
		state of the art. The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and
		650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are
		followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final
		1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and
		a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce
		overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed
		method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a
		variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test
		error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best

		Changes in consumer behavior require firms to rethink their marketing
		strategies in the digital domain. Currently, a significant portion of the
		associated research is focused more on the customer than on the firm. To
		redress this shortcoming, this study adopts the perspective of the firm to
		facilitate an understanding of digital marketing and social media usage as
		well as its benefits and inhibitors. The second generation of Internet-based
		applications enhances marketing efforts by allowing firms to implement
		innovative forms of communication and co-create content with their customers.
		Based on a survey of marketing managers, this article shows that firms face
		internal and external pressures to adopt a digital presence in social media
		platforms. Firms' digital marketing engagement can be categorized according
		to perceived benefits and digital marketing usage. To improve digital
		marketing engagement, marketers must focus on relationship-based interactions
		with their customers. This article demonstrates how some firms are already
		accomplishing just that.

		Recent progresses on deep discriminative and generative modeling have shown
		promising results on texture synthesis. However, existing feed-forward based
		methods trade off generality for efficiency, which suffer from many issues,
		such as shortage of generality (i.e., build one network per texture), lack of
		diversity (i.e., always produce visually identical output) and suboptimality
		(i.e., generate less satisfying visual effects). In this work, we focus on
		solving these issues for improved texture synthesis. We propose a deep
		generative feed-forward network which enables efficient synthesis of multiple
		textures within one single network and meaningful interpolation between them.
		Meanwhile, a suite of important techniques are introduced to achieve better
		convergence and diversity. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
		effectiveness of the proposed model and techniques for synthesizing a large

		Recent growth of social media has produced a new market for branding of
		people and businesses. Facebook provides Facebook Pages (Pages in short) for
		public figures and businesses (we call entities) to communicate with their
		fans through a Like button. Because Like counts sometimes reflect the
		popularity of entities, techniques to increase the Like count can be a matter
		of interest, and might be known as social media marketing. From an academic
		perspective, Like counts of Pages depend not only on the popularity of the
		entity, but also on the popularity of semantically related entities. For
		example, Lady Gaga's Page has many Likes; her song "Poker Face" does too. We
		can infer that her next song will acquire many Likes immediately. Important
		questions are these: How does the Like count of Lady Gaga affect the Like
		count of her song? Alternatively, how does the Like count of her song
		constitute some fraction of the Like count of Lady Gaga herself? As described
		in this paper, we strive to reveal the mutual influences of Like counts among
		semantically related entities. To measure the influence of related entities,
		we propose a problem called the Like prediction problem (LPP). It models Like
		counts of a given entity using information of related entities. The semantic
		relations among entities, expressed as RDF predicates, are obtained by
		linking each Page with the most similar DBpedia entity. Using the model
		learned by support vector regression (SVR) on LPP, we can estimate the Like
		count of a new entity e.g., Lady Gaga's new song. More importantly, we can
		analyze which RDF predicates are important to infer Like counts, providing a
		mutual influence network among entities. Our study comprises three parts: (1)
		crawling the Pages and their Like counts, (2) linking Pages to DBpedia, and
		(3) constructing features to solve the LPP. Our study, based on 20 million
		Pages with 30 billion Likes, is the largest-scale study of Facebook Likes
		ever reported. This research constitutes a new attempt to integrate
		unstructured emotional data such as Likes, with Linked data, and to provide
		new insights for branding with social media.

		We present the problem of click-through prediction for advertis-ing in
		Twitter timeline, which displays a stream of Tweets from accounts a user
		choose to follow. Traditional computational adver-tising usually appears in
		two forms: sponsored search that places ads onto the search result page when
		a query is issued to a search engine, and contextual advertising that places
		ads onto a regular, usually static Web page. Compared with these two
		paradigms, placing ads into a Tweet stream is particularly challenging given
		the nature of the data stream: the context into which an ad can be placed
		updates dynamically and never replicates. Every ad is therefore placed into a
		unique context. This makes the information available for training a machine
		learning model extremely sparse. In this study, we propose a learning-to-rank
		method which not only addresses the sparsity of training signals but also can
		be trained and updated online. The proposed method is evaluated using both
		offline experiments and online A/B tests, which involve very large
		collections of Twitter data and real Twitter users. Results of the
		experiments prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution, and its
		superiority over the current production model adopted by Twitter.

		Recently text-based sentiment prediction has been extensively studied, while

		pa-per, we study the problem of understanding human sentiments from
		large-scale social media images, considering both visual content and
		contextual in-formation, such as comments on the images, cap-tions, etc. The
		challenge of this problem lies in the " semantic gap " between low-level
		visual fea-tures and higher-level image sentiments. Moreover, the lack of
		proper annotations/labels in the major-ity of social media images presents
		another chal-lenge. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel
		Unsupervised SEntiment Analysis (USEA) framework for social media images. Our
		approach exploits relations among visual content and rele-vant contextual
		information to bridge the " semantic gap " in the prediction of image
		sentiments. With experiments on two large-scale datasets, we show that the
		proposed method is effective in addressing the two challenges.

		A key point in automatic age estimation is to design feature set essential to
		age perception. To achieve this goal, this paper builds up a hierarchical
		graphical face model for faces appearing at low, middle and high resolution
		respectively. Along the hierarchy, a face image is decomposed into detailed
		parts from coarse to fine. Then four types of features are extracted from
		this graph representation guided by the priors of aging process embedded in
		the graphical model: topology, geometry, photometry and configuration. On age
		estimation, this paper follows the popular regression formulation for mapping
		feature vectors to its age label. The effectiveness of the presented feature
		set is justified by testing results on two datasets using different kinds of
		regression methods. The experimental results in this paper show that
		designing feature set for age estimation under the guidance of hierarchical
		face model is a promising method and a flexible framework as well.

		Sarcasm detection is a key task for many natural language processing tasks.
		In sentiment analysis, for example, sarcasm can flip the polarity of an
		"apparently positive" sentence and, hence, negatively affect polarity
		detection performance. To date, most approaches to sarcasm detection have
		treated the task primarily as a text categorization problem. Sarcasm,
		however, can be expressed in very subtle ways and requires a deeper
		understanding of natural language that standard text categorization
		techniques cannot grasp. In this work, we develop models based on a
		pre-trained convolutional neural network for extracting sentiment, emotion
		and personality features for sarcasm detection. Such features, along with the
		network's baseline features, allow the proposed models to outperform the
		state of the art on benchmark datasets. We also address the often ignored
		generalizability issue of classifying data that have not been seen by the
		models at learning phase.

		Hundreds of thousands of photographs are uploaded to the internet every
		minute through various social networking and photo sharing platforms. While
		some images get millions of views, others are completely ignored. Even from
		the same users, different photographs receive different number of views. This
		begs the question: What makes a photograph popular? Can we predict the number
		of views a photograph will receive even before it is uploaded? These are some
		of the questions we address in this work. We investigate two key components
		of an image that affect its popularity, namely the image content and social
		context. Using a dataset of about 2.3 million images from Flickr, we
		demonstrate that we can reliably predict the normalized view count of images
		with a rank correlation of 0.81 using both image content and social cues. In
		this paper, we show the importance of image cues such as color, gradients,
		deep learning features and the set of objects present, as well as the
		importance of various social cues such as number of friends or number of
		photos uploaded that lead to high or low popularity of images.

		It is of significant importance to detect and manage stress before it turns
		into severe problems. However, existing stress detection methods usually rely
		on psychological scales or physiological devices, making the detection
		complicated and costly. In this paper, we explore to automatically detect
		individuals' psychological stress via social media. Employing real online
		micro-blog data, we first investigate the correlations between users' stress
		and their tweeting content, social engagement and behavior patterns. Then we
		define two types of stress-related attributes: 1) low-level content
		attributes from a single tweet, including text, images and social
		interactions; 2) user-scope statistical attributes through their weekly
		micro-blog postings, leveraging information of tweeting time, tweeting types
		and linguistic styles. To combine content attributes with statistical
		attributes, we further design a convolutional neural network (CNN) with cross
		autoencoders to generate user-scope content attributes from low-level content
		attributes. Finally, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) model to
		incorporate the two types of user-scope attributes to detect users'
		psychological stress. We test the trained model on four different datasets
		from major micro-blog platforms including Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo and
		Twitter. Experimental results show that the proposed model is effective and
		efficient on detecting psychological stress from micro-blog data. We believe
		our model would be useful in developing stress detection tools for mental
		health agencies and individuals.

		The role of images in the last ten years has changed radically due to the
		advent of social networks: from media objects mainly used to communicate
		visual information, images have become personal, associated with the people
		that create or interact with them (for example, giving a “like”). Therefore,
		in the same way that a post reveals something of its author, so now the
		images associated to a person may embed some of her individual
		characteristics, such as her personality traits. In this paper, we explore
		this new level of image understanding with the ultimate goal of relating a
		set of image preferences to personality traits by using a deep learning
		framework. In particular, our problem focuses on inferring both self-assessed
		(how the personality traits of a person can be guessed from her preferred
		image) and attributed traits (what impressions in terms of personality traits
		these images trigger in unacquainted people), learning a sort of wisdom of
		the crowds. Our characterization of each image is locked within the layers of
		a CNN, allowing us to discover more entangled attributes (aesthetic patterns
		and semantic information) and to better generalize the patterns that identify
		a trait. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
		state-of-the-art results and captures what visually characterizes a certain
		trait: using a deconvolution strategy we found a clear distinction of
		features, patterns and content between low and high values in a given trait.

Overall, the non-commercial tools outperformed their commercial counterparts. However, due to the different features offered by the tools, specific recommendations are made for each. In addition, single-sentence responses were tested in isolation to determine the extent to which they more clearly express a single polarity. Further work can be done to establish the relationship between single-sentence responses and the sentiment they express.},

abstract = {Purpose: In all projections for 2011, ROI has become of the great challenges of social media marketing for the business environment. However in the case of non-profit organizations, there is no need for such calculations. It is not as necessary to know how the effort made in these media compares to the benefits that can be obtained. This paper aims to compare the parameters governing social media ROI at an enterprise level and at the level of non-profit institutions. Additionally, the use of social media tools in a strategic plan and to save costs in the institution is discussed. Design/methodology/approach: Where ROI is defined as a mere indicator of return on investment, it involves the direct costs and revenues of each transaction. Combining the world of social media marketing, which is full of intangibles, with the current crisis makes knowing "real" return one of the greatest current needs. When demanding returns from institutions that have never been analyzed from this standpoint, it is important to understand how a tool like this can be used to justify an entity's visibility, brand improvement and ultimately, an increase in the institution's quality and use by users. Also, it should be taken into account that while in 2010 branding was the primary goal of communication in social media, this year in view of the increasingly endemic crisis, a ROI analysis can help an institution to evidence how the cost savings inherent in using these as opposed to former marketing tools substantiate their use. However, this interest involves a great risk of simplification. Findings: The analysis used to measure ROI can follow these lines: The consumption by previous users can be compared with that of current arrivals on the network. Comparisons can be made between the behavior of a user prior to following the library on social media and after doing so. The extent to which the success of new developments, events etc. has improved after being communicated in social networks can be measured. The influence of brand perception on users' consumption and the extent to which the new media have changed this perception can be measured. Originality/value: Conducting a ROI analysis of a library's social media marketing campaign can help it evaluate various aspects in the library. Social media can be considered as an interesting information dissemination tool requiring only minimal effort which can be used by the library to promote reading and publicize its informational and cultural efforts. Social media can also be used as dynamic, provision of service and marketing resources with a clear reduction in costs compared to other more traditional types of advertising and publicizing. Given that in the management of these tools, it is the contents and ideas that are essential rather than the economic resources available, social media are particularly useful for small and medium libraries as they provide the possibility of increasing the visibility of the institution and improving its service and its users' experience. Opening a new channel of communication with users on the internet is a challenge for libraries that can be optimized with the development of a strategy for the use of social media. The library should make an effort to manage these resources efficiently and obtain the largest possible return on their use. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, Pew Research Center has documented the wide variety of ways in which Americans use social media to seek out information and interact with others. A majority of Americans now say they get news via social media, and half of the public has turned to these sites to learn about the 2016 presidential election. Americans are using social media in the context of work (whether to take a mental break on the job or to seek out employment), while also engaging in an ongoing effort to navigate the complex privacy issues that these sites bring to the forefront. In addition to measuring the broad impact and meaning of social media, since 2012 the Center has also tracked the specific sites and platforms that users turn to in the course of living their social lives online. In that context, a national survey of 1,520 adults conducted March 7-April 4, 2016, finds that Facebook continues to be America's most popular social networking platform by a substantial margin: Nearly eight-in-ten online Americans 1 (79%) now use Facebook, more than double the share that uses Twitter (24%), Pinterest (31%), Instagram (32%) or LinkedIn (29%). On a total population basis (accounting for Americans who do not use the internet at all), that means that 68% of all U.S. adults are Facebook users, while 28% use Instagram, 26% use Pinterest, 25% use LinkedIn and 21% use Twitter. Thanks in part to the growing number of older adults who are joining the site, Facebook use appears to be on the rise: The share of online adults who report using Facebook has increased by 7 percentage points compared with a Pew Research Center survey conducted at a similar point in 2015. In addition, the share of Facebook users who check in daily has increased slightly in the past year: 76% of Americans who use Facebook now report that they visit the site on a daily basis, up from 70% in 2015. },

Design/methodology/approach - In order to achieve this goal, an experiment using eye-tracking technology was administered to a total of 20 participants from a major university in the USA, followed by a questionnaire. Findings - Findings show that online ads attract less attention levels than friends' recommendations. A possible explanation for this phenomenon may be related to the fact that ads on Facebook are outside of the F-shaped visual pattern range, causing a state of "banner blindness". Results also show that statistically there is no difference in ads seen and clicked between women and men. Research limitations/implications - The sample type (undergraduate and graduate students) and the sample size (20 participants) inhibit the generalization of the findings to other populations. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for the development of an effective online advertising campaign, as well as some proposed conceptualizations of the terms social network site and advertising, which can be used as platforms for discussion or as standards for future definitions.

abstract = {For e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and Amazon, advertisers play an important role in the entire digital ecosystem: their behaviors explicitly influence users' browsing and shopping experience; more importantly, advertiser's expenditure on advertising constitutes a primary source of platform revenue. Therefore, providing better services for advertisers is essential for the long-term prosperity for e-commerce platforms. To achieve this goal, the ad platform needs to have an in-depth understanding of advertisers in terms of both their marketing intents and satisfaction over the advertising performance, based on which further optimization could be carried out to service the advertisers in the correct direction. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Satisfaction Prediction Network (DSPN), which models advertiser intent and satisfaction simultaneously. It employs a two-stage network structure where advertiser intent vector and satisfaction are jointly learned by considering the features of advertiser's action information and advertising performance indicators. Experiments on an Alibaba advertisement dataset and online evaluations show that our proposed DSPN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and has stable performance in terms of AUC in the online environment. Further analyses show that DSPN not only predicts advertisers' satisfaction accurately but also learns an explainable advertiser intent, revealing the opportunities to optimize the advertising performance further.},

abstract = {The multibillion-dollar online advertising industry continues to debate whether to use the cost per click (CPC) or cost per action (CPA) pricing model as an industry standard. This paper applies the economic framework of incentive contracts to study how these pricing models can lead to risk sharing between the publisher and the advertiser and incentivize them to make efforts that improve the performance of online ads. We find that, compared with the CPC model, the CPA model can better incentivize the publisher to make efforts that can improve the purchase rate. However, the CPA model can cause an adverse selection problem: the winning advertiser tends to have a lower profit margin under the CPA model than under the CPC model. We identify the conditions under which the CPA model leads to higher publisher (or advertiser) payoffs than the CPC model. Whether publishers (or advertisers) prefer the CPA model over the CPC model depends on the advertisers' risk aversion, uncertainty in the product market, and the presence of advertisers with low immediate sales ratios. Our findings indicate a conflict of interest between publishers and advertisers in their preferences for these two pricing models. We further consider which pricing model offers greater social welfare.},

abstract = {The development of technology in industry 3.0 which was marked by the emergence of internet innovation in the 1980s has changed many practices in the industries, include advertising practice. Data showed that Internet User in Indonesia increased in line with the increase in advertising spending. Therefore, it is interesting to discuss online advertising and its effectiveness for advertisers and consumers. The aims of this paper are to provide a review and understand much deeper regarding concept of online advertising and its effectiveness from consumers and advertiser's point of view. The paradigm that is used in this study is the constructivist paradigm. The approach used on this study is a qualitative approach. This study used the meta-analysis method. This study also used secondary data obtained from several official web institutions. The data showed that there was an escalation on internet users in Indonesia and on digital advertising spending in 2006 to 2007. This shows an opportunity for advertisers to practice online advertising. This paper found several factors that could increase the effectiveness of online advertising so that it can bring up click action from internet users. The combination of the right size, the right message content, and interesting forms of advertising are concluded to increase the effectiveness of online advertising in generating click-through and awareness of internet users. Size of online ads that are not too large, appropriate short messages and does not attack the user's life values, will be more effective in attracting users to click on ad.},

Mining online opinion is a form of sentiment analysis that is treated as a difficult text classification task. In this paper, we explore the role of text pre-processing in sentiment analysis, and report on experimental results that demonstrate that with appropriate feature selection and representation, sentiment analysis accuracies using support vector machines (SVM) in this area may be significantly improved. The level of accuracy achieved is shown to be comparable to the ones achieved in topic categorisation although sentiment analysis is considered to be a much harder problem in the literature.}

abstract = {Text preprocessing is often the first step in the pipeline of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system, with potential impact in its final performance. Despite its importance, text preprocessing has not received much attention in the deep learning literature. In this paper we investigate the impact of simple text preprocessing decisions (particularly tokenizing, lemmatizing, lowercasing and multiword grouping) on the performance of a standard neural text classifier. We perform an extensive evaluation on standard benchmarks from text categorization and sentiment analysis. While our experiments show that a simple tokenization of input text is generally adequate, they also highlight significant degrees of variability across preprocessing techniques. This reveals the importance of paying attention to this usually-overlooked step in the pipeline, particularly when comparing different models. Finally, our evaluation provides insights into the best preprocessing practices for training word embeddings.},

abstract = {Social media users are increasingly using both images and text to express their opinions and share their experiences, instead of only using text in the conventional social media. Consequently, the conventional text-based sentiment analysis has evolved into more complicated studies of multimodal sentiment analysis. To tackle the challenge of how to effectively exploit the information from both visual content and textual content from image-text posts, this paper proposes a new image-text consistency driven multimodal sentiment analysis approach. The proposed approach explores the correlation between the image and the text, followed by a multimodal adaptive sentiment analysis method. To be more specific, the mid-level visual features extracted by the conventional SentiBank approach are used to represent visual concepts, with the integration of other features, including textual, visual and social features, to develop a machine learning sentiment analysis approach. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Smart cities are a growing paradigm in the design of systems that interact with one another for informed and efficient decision making, empowered by data and technology, of resources in a city. The diffusion of information to citizens in a smart city will rely on social trends and smart advertisement. Online social networks (OSNs) are prominent and increasingly important platforms to spread information, observe social trends, and advertise new products. To maximize the benefits of such platforms in sharing information, many groups invest in finding ways to maximize the expected number of clicks as a proxy of these platform's performance. As such, the study of click-through rate (CTR) prediction of advertisements, in environments like online social media, is of much interest. Prior works build machine learning (ML) using user-specific data to classify whether a user will click on an advertisement or not. For our work, we consider a large set of Facebook advertisement data (with no user data) and categorize targeted interests into thematic groups we call conceptual nodes. ML models are trained using the advertisement data to perform CTR prediction with conceptual node combinations. We then cast the problem of finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes as an optimization problem. Given a certain budget k, we are interested in finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes that maximize the CTR. We discuss the hardness and possible NP-hardness of the optimization problem. Then, we propose a greedy algorithm and a genetic algorithm to find near-optimal combinations of conceptual nodes in polynomial time, with the genetic algorithm nearly matching the optimal solution. We observe that simple ML models can exhibit the high Pearson correlation coefficients w.r.t. click predictions and real click values. Additionally, we find that the conceptual nodes of 'politics', 'celebrity', and 'organization' are notably more influential than other considered conceptual nodes.},

abstract = {This paper develops unique new insight for business practitioners and academic researchers into the interaction between consumers and brands on social media platforms, principally where brands choose to interact with, and amplify, user-generated content (UGC) by retweeting it on their own brand channels. Despite increasing research into social media in general, there is a relative lack of available academic research on major brands engaging with consumer content, which may, be in part due to the pace of change and exponential growth in this emerging area. This mixed method study develops insight conducted over an 18-month period with leading social media practitioners, concluding that primarily a brand's social media team opportunistically seek out and retweet organic image-led UGC to convey specific messages across multiple platforms. Content containing imagery lends authenticity to brand storytelling; brands with tangible products are more likely to receive organic UGC which contains images than intangible brands.},

abstract = {Background: Visual imagery plays a key role in health communication; however, there is little understanding of what aspects of vaccine-related images make them effective communication aids. Twitter, a popular venue for discussions related to vaccination, provides numerous images that are shared with tweets. Objective: The objectives of this study were to understand how images are used in vaccine-related tweets and provide guidance with respect to the characteristics of vaccine-related images that correlate with the higher likelihood of being retweeted. Methods: We collected more than one million vaccine image messages from Twitter and characterized various properties of these images using automated image analytics. We fit a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a vaccine image tweet was retweeted, thus identifying characteristics that correlate with a higher likelihood of being shared. For comparison, we built similar models for the sharing of vaccine news on Facebook and for general image tweets. Results: Most vaccine-related images are duplicates (125,916/237,478; 53.02%) or taken from other sources, not necessarily created by the author of the tweet. Almost half of the images contain embedded text, and many include images of people and syringes. The visual content is highly correlated with a tweet's textual topics. Vaccine image tweets are twice as likely to be shared as nonimage tweets. The sentiment of an image and the objects shown in the image were the predictive factors in determining whether an image was retweeted. Conclusions: We are the first to study vaccine images on Twitter. Our findings suggest future directions for the study and use of vaccine imagery and may inform communication strategies around vaccination. Furthermore, our study demonstrates an effective study methodology for image analysis. },

abstract = {Objectives: Recruitment of sufficient sample size into clinical trials is challenging. Conventional advertising methods are expensive and are often ineffective. The effectiveness of Facebook for recruitment into blood pressure clinical trials of middle-to-older-aged people is unknown. This study aimed to assess this by comparing Facebook advertising with conventional recruitment methods from a retrospective analysis within a clinical trial. Methods: Conventional advertisements (newspaper, radio and posters) were employed for the first 20 months of a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in three Australian capital cities from Tasmania, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. With dwindling participant recruitment, at 20 months a Facebook advertising campaign was employed intermittently over a 4-month period. Recruitment results were retrospectively compared with those using conventional methods in the previous 4 months. Results: Compared with conventional recruitment methods, Facebook advertisement was associated with a significant increase in the number of participants recruited in the Australian Capital Territory (from an average 1.8-7.3/month; P<0.05). There was also an increase in Tasmania that was of borderline significance (from 4.0 participants recruited/month to 9.3/month; P=0.052). However, there was no effect in Queensland (from 6.0 participants recruited/month to 3.0/month; P=0.15). Facebook advertisement was associated with a significant decrease in the age of participants enquiring into the study (from 60.9 to 58.7 years; P<0.001). Conclusion: Facebook advertising was successful in helping to increase recruitment of middle-to-older aged participants into a blood pressure clinical trial, although there may be some variability in effect that is dependent on location.},
